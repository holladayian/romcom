# Project Romcom: Romance Novel Generator
## Paired project by Naomi Ware & Ian Holladay
Turing's 2005FE week 2 paired projects

## The link to our project can be found here:

## Project Overview
We designed a webpage using primarily JavaScript (the HTML and CSS were provided by our instructors) that generates a random romcom novel cover, and has functionality to create and save custom covers based on user input.
In short, this webpage will:
- Generate random romcom covers
- Create custom covers from user input form
- Save random and user input covers if desired
- View saved covers on a separate page
- Delete saved covers

## Learning Goals
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data
- Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
- Manipulate the page after is has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements
- Begin to understand how to write effective, clean HTML & CSS

## Wins
- Both partners understanding every line of code in our project (yay learning!)
- Being able to work on and complete a project remotely from one another
- Integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Better understanding git workflow-e.g. push/pull requests, branches, and merging of said branches
- The app actually works!

## Challenges
- Working remotely
- Learning how to manipulate the DOM
- Learning how to integrate multiple data types
- Learning how to properly collaborate through git workflow
- Understanding event bubbling
- Learning how to utilize adjacent HTML insertion

On this page, users can create a custom cover (as weird and cheesy as they like).
